# Linux Server Setup Scripts

## Overview

This directory contains a collection of personally curated scripts designed to streamline the initial setup and configuration of Linux servers. These scripts automate common tasks that are typically performed when preparing a fresh server environment for production or development use.

## Purpose

Setting up a Linux server from scratch involves numerous repetitive tasks such as:
- Installing essential packages and dependencies
- Configuring system settings and security measures
- Setting up development tools and environments
- Applying security hardening practices
- Configuring user accounts and permissions
- Installing and configuring commonly used software

These scripts aim to reduce manual work, ensure consistency across server deployments, and minimize the potential for human error during the setup process.

## Usage Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- Fresh Linux server installation (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.)
- Root or sudo access
- Basic understanding of Linux command line

### General Usage
1. Review the scripts before execution to understand what changes will be made
2. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x script_name.sh`
3. Run with appropriate privileges (usually requiring sudo)
4. Monitor output for any errors or required user input

### Best Practices
- **Always backup** important data before running setup scripts
- Test scripts in a non-production environment first
- Review and customize scripts according to your specific needs
- Keep scripts updated with latest security practices
- Document any modifications made to the original scripts

## Security Considerations

- Scripts may modify system configurations and install software
- Review all commands before execution, especially those requiring root privileges
- Ensure scripts are from trusted sources
- Consider running in isolated environments for testing
- Some scripts may require network access to download packages

## Compatibility

These scripts are designed for common Linux distributions and may require modifications for:
- Different package managers (apt, yum, dnf, pacman, etc.)
- Varying system configurations
- Specific version requirements
- Custom server environments

## Support

These are personal scripts shared for community benefit. While tested in specific environments, use at your own discretion and adapt as needed for your particular setup requirements.
